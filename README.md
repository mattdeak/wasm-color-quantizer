# K-Means Color Reducer
This is a simple tool I created to share a color reducer with a pixel artist friend. It's a quick and dirty way to reduce the number of colors in an image using the K-means clustering algorithm.



## Access

You can access and use this tool right here: [https://mattdeak.github.io/kmeans-color-reducer/](https://mattdeak.github.io/kmeans-color-reducer/). It's embedded into a simple static site for ease.

## How it Works

This color reducer uses Rust compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) to perform the K-means calculation quickly and efficiently in the browser.


Feel free to use this tool for whatever you like.
